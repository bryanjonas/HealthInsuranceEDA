# Spring Semester, Session 2: Questions and Plans

This intent of this session is help answer any questions about data access, use of the DSP, methodology, and/or anything else that you need to help you get started with this semester's project-based curriculum.

The first question we will focus on is: How to plan rates vary across states?

Please come to this session having considering your approach for this analysis and armed with any questions you would need assistance with.

As a starting point, I would check out the "Data Dictionary" files located here: https://www.cms.gov/cciio/resources/data-resources/marketplace-puf

These files will help you understand the data files structure and what is available to you in this dataset.
